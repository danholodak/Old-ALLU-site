<p class="style1">Teri Kman's Profile:<br />
  <br />
  I am a wildlife biologist, writer, and artist with a studio in the gorgeous Rocky Mountain foothills of Colorado. I've had the great privilege of working with many animal species, including sea turtles, Mexican lobos, pronghorn, falcons, shorebirds, sea birds, snakes, geckoes, and lizards. My first degree is in art from Tyler School of Art (Temple University, Philadelphia).</p>
